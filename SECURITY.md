## Security Overview

OpenAuditLabs Agent is a sophisticated AI-powered smart contract auditing platform that leverages CrewAI, Slither, Mythril, and other security tools. Given the critical nature of smart contract security and the autonomous capabilities of AI agents, maintaining robust security practices is paramount to protecting both our system and our users' assets.

### Core Security Principles

- **Defense in Depth**: Multi-layered security approach across all system components
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify every interaction, never assume trust
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal necessary permissions for all components
- **Transparency**: Open security practices and clear audit trails
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response

```

### Security Boundaries

1. **External Boundary**: WAF, rate limiting, DDoS protection
2. **API Boundary**: Authentication, authorization, input validation
3. **Agent Boundary**: Sandboxed execution, resource limits
4. **Data Boundary**: Encryption, access controls, audit logging
5. **Tool Boundary**: Isolated execution environments

---

## AI Agent Security Framework

### Agent Authorization & Authentication

All AI agents operate within a secure authentication framework:

```yaml
Agent Security Model:
  - Identity: Unique agent identifiers with cryptographic signatures
  - Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) with minimal privileges
  - Session Management: Time-bound tokens with automatic rotation
  - Tool Access: Explicit permission grants for external tool usage
```

### Agent Behavior Monitoring

- **Action Logging**: All agent decisions and tool invocations logged
- **Anomaly Detection**: Behavioral pattern analysis for suspicious activity
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and network usage tracking
- **Output Validation**: AI-generated content scanning and filtering

### Prompt Injection Prevention

Following OWASP AI security guidelines:

- **Input Sanitization**: Strict validation of all user inputs
- **Context Isolation**: Separation of user data from system prompts
- **Output Filtering**: Content scanning for malicious instructions
- **Privilege Boundaries**: Agent capabilities strictly limited

### Tool Integration Security

- **Sandboxed Execution**: All security tools run in isolated containers
- **Command Validation**: Whitelist approach for tool parameters
- **Result Verification**: Output validation before processing
- **Access Controls**: Fine-grained permissions for tool access

---

## Audit Process Security

### Secure Audit Pipeline

```

### Code Handling Security

- **Isolation**: Each audit runs in a separate container environment
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and time constraints
- **Network Segmentation**: No external network access during analysis
- **Data Sanitization**: Automatic cleanup after audit completion

### Audit Tool Security

**Slither Security:**
- Updated vulnerability signatures
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Output sanitization and validation

**Mythril Security:**
- Isolated symbolic execution

### Report Integrity

- **Digital Signatures**: All reports cryptographically signed
- **Immutable Storage**: Blockchain-based audit trail
- **Access Logging**: Complete chain of custody tracking
- **Version Control**: Tamper-evident report versioning

---

## Container & Infrastructure Security

### Docker Security

Following Docker security best practices:

```dockerfile
# Security-hardened base images
FROM debian:12-slim as base
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y

# Non-root user execution
RUN groupadd -r appuser && useradd -r -g appuser appuser
USER appuser

# Resource limits and security options
SECURITY_OPT: ["no-new-privileges:true"]
CAP_DROP: ["ALL"]
CAP_ADD: ["CHOWN", "SETGID", "SETUID"]
```

### Container Scanning

## Security Guidelines for Contributors

### Secure Development Practices

#### Code Security

```python
# Input validation example
def validate_contract_input(contract_code: str) -> bool:
    """Validate smart contract input with strict sanitization."""
    if not contract_code or len(contract_code) > MAX_CONTRACT_SIZE:
        return False
    
    # Check for malicious patterns
    forbidden_patterns = [
        r'eval\s*\(',
        r'exec\s*\(',
        r'import\s+os',
        r'subprocess\.'
    ]
    
    for pattern in forbidden_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, contract_code):
            return False
    
    return True
```

#### Security Testing Requirements

- **Static Analysis**: Pre-commit hooks with Bandit and Semgrep
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability checks
- **Container Scanning**: Image security validation
- **Integration Tests**: Security-focused test scenarios

#### Pre-commit Security Hooks

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml security hooks
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit
    rev: 1.7.5
    hooks:
      - id: bandit
        args: ['-r', 'src/']
  
  - repo: https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint
    rev: v2.12.0
    hooks:
      - id: hadolint-docker
```

### Secret Management

**Never commit secrets to version control:**

```bash
# Use environment variables
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
REDIS_URL=${REDIS_URL}
API_SECRET_KEY=${API_SECRET_KEY}

# Use .env files (git ignored)
echo "*.env" >> .gitignore
echo "secrets/" >> .gitignore
```

### Secure Configuration

**Database Configuration:**
```python
DATABASE_CONFIG = {
    'encrypt': True,
    'ssl_mode': 'require',
    'connection_timeout': 30,
    'max_connections': 100,
    'pool_pre_ping': True
}
```

**API Security Configuration:**
```python
SECURITY_CONFIG = {
    'rate_limit': '100/minute',
    'jwt_secret_key': os.getenv('JWT_SECRET_KEY'),
    'session_timeout': 3600,
    'password_hash_rounds': 12
}
```
