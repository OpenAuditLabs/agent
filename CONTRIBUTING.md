### Code Contributions

#### Finding Issues to Work On

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginner-friendly tasks
- Check issues labeled `help wanted` for more complex contributions
- Feel free to propose your own improvements

#### Before You Start

1. **Comment on the issue** you'd like to work on
2. **Wait for confirmation** from maintainers (to avoid duplicate work)
3. **Ask questions** if anything is unclear

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards

- **Follow PEP 8** for Python code style
- **Use type hints** where appropriate
- **Write descriptive variable and function names**
- **Add docstrings** for all public functions and classes
- **Keep functions focused** and maintain single responsibility
- **Use meaningful commit messages** (see [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/))

**Example:**
```python
def analyze_audit_data(data: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> AuditResult:
    """
    Analyze audit data and return findings.
    
    Args:
        data: List of audit data dictionaries
        
    Returns:
        AuditResult object containing analysis results
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If data is empty or invalid
    """
    if not data:
        raise ValueError("Audit data cannot be empty")
    
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### Testing

- **Write tests** for all new functionality
- **Maintain test coverage** above 80%
- **Use pytest** for testing framework
- **Include both unit and integration tests**
- **Test error conditions** and edge cases

**Test file structure:**
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_agent_core.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_audit_analyzer.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_agent_workflow.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/
    â”œâ”€â”€ sample_audit_data.json
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=openauditlabs_agent

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_agent_core.py
```
