# Agentic AI for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection and Mitigation

## 1. Introduction

Smart contracts are self-executing programs running on blockchain platforms, primarily Ethereum, coded in languages like Solidity. Despite their benefits, smart contracts are susceptible to security vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial and reputational losses. Traditional manual auditing methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and incapable of scaling with the growing number of deployed contracts.

The emergence of agentic AI, which combines language models with autonomous decision-making capabilities, opens new avenues for intelligent automation in cybersecurity. This proposal aims to develop an agentic AI framework that automatically analyzes, detects, scores, and mitigates vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts.

## 2. Problem Statement

Smart contract vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflows/underflows, unhandled exceptions, and gas-related issues are prevalent and exploited frequently. Existing tools offer either static or dynamic analysis, often requiring expert intervention for interpreting results and applying fixes. There is a critical need for an end-to-end AI system that autonomously identifies and mitigates these vulnerabilities while learning continuously from new threats.

## 3. Objectives

- To develop an AI-based framework for automated auditing of Solidity smart contracts.
- To implement a vulnerability scoring engine based on CVSS or similar frameworks.
- To integrate agentic AI (LLMs with tools) that can suggest and optionally apply fixes.
- To continuously train the model using a reinforcement learning approach based on real-world vulnerability data.
