# Agentic AI for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection and Mitigation

## 1. Introduction

Smart contracts are self-executing programs running on blockchain platforms, primarily Ethereum, coded in languages like Solidity. Despite their benefits, smart contracts are susceptible to security vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial and reputational losses. Traditional manual auditing methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and incapable of scaling with the growing number of deployed contracts.

The emergence of agentic AI, which combines large language models (LLMs) with autonomous decision-making and tool-using capabilities, opens new avenues for intelligent automation in cybersecurity. By leveraging LLMs trained on curated datasets of smart contracts and known vulnerability patterns, agentic AI can provide deep contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities. This proposal aims to develop an agentic AI framework that automatically analyzes, detects, scores, and mitigates vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts.

## 2. Problem Statement

Smart contract vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflows/underflows, unhandled exceptions, and gas-related issues are prevalent and exploited frequently. Existing tools offer either static or dynamic analysis, often requiring expert intervention for interpreting results and applying fixes. There is a critical need for an end-to-end AI system that autonomously identifies and mitigates these vulnerabilities while learning continuously from new threats.

## 3. Objectives

- To develop an AI-based framework for automated auditing of Solidity smart contracts.
- To implement a vulnerability scoring engine based on CVSS or similar frameworks.
- To integrate agentic AI (LLMs with tools) that can suggest and optionally apply fixes.
- To continuously train the model using a reinforcement learning approach based on real-world vulnerability data.

## 4. Literature Review

A rapidly growing body of research addresses the detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts using various AI, ML, and symbolic methods:

- **Luu et al. (2016)** introduced *Oyente*, a symbolic execution tool that detects common vulnerabilities but lacks autonomous remediation capabilities.
- **Tsankov et al. (2018)** developed *Securify*, a static analysis framework that flags property violations but does not offer adaptive fixes.
- **Chen et al. (2020)** surveyed the use of AI in blockchain cybersecurity, highlighting anomaly detection promise but noting high false-positive rates and no repair suggestions.
- **Feng et al. (2023)** proposed an interpretable model using feature selection and deep learning that achieves over 93% detection accuracy across six vulnerability types, with significantly faster training times.
- A comprehensive survey by **Ozdag (2025)** reviews AI-driven vulnerability detection, covering ML, DL, GNN, and transformer-based techniques, and outlining challenges in interpretability and deployment.
- **Kumar et al. (2022)** examined GPT‑3 for Solidity code generation, laying groundwork for LLM-based code understanding, yet noting that full remediation is not yet realized.
- **SmartLLM (2025)** introduced a custom LLaMA-based auditing agent achieving perfect recall and 70% accuracy by combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and zero-shot prompting.
- **SOChecker (2024)** detects vulnerabilities in StackOverflow code snippets using fine-tuned LLaMA2 and symbolic execution, outperforming GPT-3.5/4 with an F1 score of 68.2%.
- **MDPI‑ApplSci (2023)** employed reinforcement learning (PPO) with contract CFGs to identify unchecked-call vulnerabilities, showing improved stability over DQN.
- **AI-based NFT contract analysis (2025)** used CART and random forests on 16,527 contracts to classify key vulnerabilities such as reentrancy and excessive minting.
- **Smartify (2025)** presented a multi-agent LLM framework for detection and repair in Solidity and Move, illustrating the feasibility of closed-loop patching.
- **A1 exploit-generation agent (2025)** transforms LLMs into autonomous smart contract attackers using domain-specific tools and execution feedback.

Despite strong progress, most existing solutions focus on detection with limited remediation. There is still no fully agentic system that combines detection, scoring, autonomous patching, validation, and continuous learning. This proposal addresses that gap with a reinforcement-driven, closed-loop AI framework.

## 5. Methodology

### Data Collection

- Collect vulnerability data from the Smart Contract Weakness Classification (SWC), real-world exploited contracts, and public repositories (e.g., GitHub, Etherscan).
- Curate a training dataset composed of vulnerable and patched Solidity code pairs to fine-tune LLMs.

### Static & Dynamic Analysis

- Integrate established tools such as Mythril, Slither, and Manticore to extract vulnerability patterns.
- Use dynamic fuzzing tools like Echidna to observe runtime behavior.

### Scoring Engine

- Develop a CVSS-inspired scoring mechanism with tunable severity parameters.
- Use historical exploit impact data and heuristics to calibrate the scoring system.

### Agentic AI Framework

- Use GPT-4 or fine-tuned LLaMA models trained on Solidity code, known vulnerabilities, and repair datasets to guide interpretation and suggestion.
- Implement a tool-use module for invoking static analyzers, validators, and sandboxed test environments through structured APIs.
- Design autonomous agents capable of orchestrating detection, suggesting patches, validating outcomes, and documenting fixes.
- Introduce retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply relevant vulnerability patterns during inference.

### Reinforcement Learning Loop

- Define reward functions based on successful remediation, passing test cases, absence of regressions, and exploit resistance.
- Incorporate developer feedback, automated CI/CD evaluations, and simulated adversarial attacks for environment shaping.
- Enable continuous learning via policy gradient methods or PPO.

## 6. Expected Outcomes

- A functional, LLM-driven agentic AI system for Solidity contract auditing and patch generation.
- Improved precision, recall, and F1 score compared to traditional analysis tools.
- Integration with developer IDEs, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD pipelines for seamless use.
- A continuously learning and improving AI agent trained on real-world contract data and feedback.
- A growing dataset of real, synthetic, and patched smart contracts that can be open-sourced for research reproducibility and community use.

## 7. Implications and Impact

This research can reduce the reliance on manual audits, enable real-time feedback for developers, and prevent significant financial losses due to undetected smart contract flaws. By harnessing the power of LLMs trained on specialized smart contract datasets, the system can offer context-aware suggestions and autonomous mitigation. The framework has the potential for deployment in commercial blockchain security platforms, educational tools, and open-source ecosystems.
