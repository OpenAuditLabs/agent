# Agentic AI for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection and Mitigation

## 1. Introduction

Smart contracts are self-executing programs running on blockchain platforms, primarily Ethereum, coded in languages like Solidity. Despite their benefits, smart contracts are susceptible to security vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial and reputational losses. Traditional manual auditing methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and incapable of scaling with the growing number of deployed contracts.

The emergence of agentic AI, which combines large language models (LLMs) with autonomous decision-making and tool-using capabilities, opens new avenues for intelligent automation in cybersecurity. By leveraging LLMs trained on curated datasets of smart contracts and known vulnerability patterns, agentic AI can provide deep contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities. This proposal aims to develop an agentic AI framework that automatically analyzes, detects, scores, and mitigates vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts.

## 2. Problem Statement

Smart contract vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflows/underflows, unhandled exceptions, and gas-related issues are prevalent and exploited frequently. Existing tools offer either static or dynamic analysis, often requiring expert intervention for interpreting results and applying fixes. There is a critical need for an end-to-end AI system that autonomously identifies and mitigates these vulnerabilities while learning continuously from new threats.

## 3. Objectives

- To develop an AI-based framework for automated auditing of Solidity smart contracts.
- To implement a vulnerability scoring engine based on CVSS or similar frameworks.
- To integrate agentic AI (LLMs with tools) that can suggest and optionally apply fixes.
- To continuously train the model using a reinforcement learning approach based on real-world vulnerability data.

## 4. Literature Review

A rapidly growing body of research addresses the detection and mitigation of vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts using various AI, ML, and symbolic methods:

- **Luu et al. (2016)** introduced *Oyente*, a symbolic execution tool that detects common vulnerabilities but lacks autonomous remediation capabilities. It effectively detects vulnerabilities like reentrancy, timestamp dependence, and transaction-ordering dependence by symbolically analyzing execution paths. However, Oyente does not provide any suggestion for remediating detected issues, and it requires expert interpretation of results, limiting its usability for developers unfamiliar with symbolic analysis.

- **Tsankov et al. (2018)** developed *Securify*, a static analysis framework that flags property violations but does not offer adaptive fixes. It utilizes a Datalog-based engine to infer semantic facts about the contract and checks them against compliance and violation patterns. While effective for flagging certain classes of vulnerabilities, Securify lacks adaptive learning and cannot suggest or validate code-level repairs, making it less helpful in automated or continuous deployment scenarios.

- **Chen et al. (2020)** surveyed the use of AI in blockchain cybersecurity, highlighting anomaly detection promise but noting high false-positive rates and no repair suggestions. The study highlights the potential of machine learning in identifying malicious behaviors in smart contracts, but also notes significant limitations including high false-positive rates, limited explainability, and the absence of actionable repair mechanisms, a gap that agentic AI can potentially bridge.

- **Feng et al. (2023)** proposed an interpretable model using feature selection and deep learning that achieves over 93% detection accuracy across six vulnerability types, with significantly faster training times.

- A comprehensive survey by **Ozdag (2025)** reviews AI-driven vulnerability detection, covering ML, DL, GNN, and transformer-based techniques, and outlining challenges in interpretability and deployment.

- **Kumar et al. (2022)** examined GPT‑3 for Solidity code generation, laying groundwork for LLM-based code understanding, yet noting that full remediation is not yet realized.

- **SmartLLM (2025)** introduced a custom LLaMA-based auditing agent achieving perfect recall and 70% accuracy by combining retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and zero-shot prompting.

- **SOChecker (2024)** detects vulnerabilities in StackOverflow code snippets using fine-tuned LLaMA2 and symbolic execution, outperforming GPT-3.5/4 with an F1 score of 68.2%.

- **MDPI‑ApplSci (2023)** employed reinforcement learning (PPO) with contract CFGs to identify unchecked-call vulnerabilities, showing improved stability over DQN.

- **Zhu et al. (2024)** proposed *ChainGuard*, a multi-agent LLM-augmented framework for smart contract auditing that combines retrieval-based evidence aggregation with executable patch testing. It features task-specific agents for code inspection, exploit simulation, and patch validation, achieving over 78% success in automatic patch deployment on benchmark contracts. ChainGuard demonstrates the effectiveness of agent orchestration and interpretable feedback in reducing hallucinated fixes and improving developer trust.

Prior work has laid the foundation for analyzing and mitigating vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Oyente and Securify introduced static and symbolic analysis methods for vulnerability detection. **Zeus** (Kalra et al., 2018) was among the first to integrate formal verification with both symbolic and concrete execution, achieving improved precision. Its dual approach helps bridge traditional symbolic tools and the hybrid agentic framework proposed here. These tools inform the structure and reasoning capabilities of the agents in our system.

Recently, **AuditGPT** (Mehta et al., 2024) introduced a hybrid LLM-driven pipeline for static code auditing using prompt chaining, vulnerability classifiers, and code embeddings. Their framework used retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to minimize hallucinations in LLM-generated vulnerability explanations. AuditGPT’s focus on explainability and structured bug reporting strongly aligns with the agentic design we propose, especially in tasks like automated risk scoring and human-aligned patch generation. We build upon their modularity principle and integrate additional agentic feedback loops to enhance system adaptability.

- **AI-based NFT contract analysis (2025)** used CART and random forests on 16,527 contracts to classify key vulnerabilities such as reentrancy and excessive minting.

- **Smartify (2025)** presented a multi-agent LLM framework for detection and repair in Solidity and Move, illustrating the feasibility of closed-loop patching.

- **A1 exploit-generation agent (2025)** transforms LLMs into autonomous smart contract attackers using domain-specific tools and execution feedback.

- **Park & Zheng (2025)** proposed *Multi-modal Smart Contract Reasoning (MSCR)*, a transformer architecture that integrates code syntax, CFGs, and bytecode traces. MSCR outperformed single-modal systems by 17% F1 and demonstrated superior cross-chain generalization and adversarial robustness.

- **Nguyen et al. (2025)** introduced *TARA*, a trust-aware patching agent that uses developer feedback, safety oracles, and confidence-based filtering. TARA mitigates hallucinated patches by learning from HITL feedback loops and improves system reliability over time.

Despite strong progress, most existing solutions focus on detection with limited remediation. There is still no fully agentic system that combines detection, scoring, autonomous patching, validation, and continuous learning. This proposal addresses that gap with a reinforcement-driven, closed-loop AI framework.


## 5. Methodology

### Data Collection

- Collect vulnerability data from the Smart Contract Weakness Classification (SWC), real-world exploited contracts, and public repositories (e.g., GitHub, Etherscan).
- Curate a training dataset composed of vulnerable and patched Solidity code pairs to fine-tune LLMs.

### Static & Dynamic Analysis

- Integrate established tools such as Mythril, Slither, and Manticore to extract vulnerability patterns.
- Use dynamic fuzzing tools like Echidna to observe runtime behavior.

### Scoring Engine

- Develop a CVSS-inspired scoring mechanism with tunable severity parameters.
- Use historical exploit impact data and heuristics to calibrate the scoring system.

### Agentic AI Framework

- Use GPT-4 or fine-tuned LLaMA models trained on Solidity code, known vulnerabilities, and repair datasets to guide interpretation and suggestion.
- Implement a tool-use module for invoking static analyzers, validators, and sandboxed test environments through structured APIs.
- Design autonomous agents capable of orchestrating detection, suggesting patches, validating outcomes, and documenting fixes.
- Introduce retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to supply relevant vulnerability patterns during inference.

### Reinforcement Learning Loop

- Define reward functions based on successful remediation, passing test cases, absence of regressions, and exploit resistance.
- Incorporate developer feedback, automated CI/CD evaluations, and simulated adversarial attacks for environment shaping.
- Enable continuous learning via policy gradient methods or PPO.

### 5.5 Human-in-the-Loop Feedback and Trust Calibration

Despite advances in LLMs and symbolic analyzers, automated remediation can result in hallucinated or unsafe code fixes. To bridge this gap, our framework introduces a **trust-calibrated human-in-the-loop (HITL) system** that allows developers to review, approve, or reject patches. This component serves multiple functions:

- **Trust Scores**: Each fix is annotated with a confidence score derived from multi-modal consistency checks (syntax, bytecode, dynamic tests).
- **Interactive Patch Review**: Developers can view suggested changes side-by-side with explanations, allowing them to approve or re-edit before deployment.
- **Feedback Integration**: Rejected patches trigger fine-tuning or prompt adjustment in the LLM agent, reinforcing safe behavior.

By blending automation with developer oversight, the system becomes both more **secure** and **explainable**, fostering **adoption in high-stakes environments** such as DeFi and enterprise blockchains.

### 5.6 Cross-Chain Vulnerability Generalization and Zero-Day Detection

As decentralized applications increasingly span multiple blockchain platforms, vulnerabilities unique to cross-chain interactions are emerging. Our framework extends support for **cross-chain contract auditing** by incorporating ideas from *CrossFuzz* (Jiang et al., 2024), a differential fuzzing framework that discovers **zero-day vulnerabilities** through execution divergence between functionally similar contracts on different chains.

To adapt this:

- The agentic system will incorporate **cross-chain semantic diffing**, using AST and control/data flow graphs.
- Autonomous agents will analyze and fuzz functionally-equivalent smart contracts across EVM-compatible chains (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, BSC) to detect inconsistencies.
- The RL loop will include zero-day exploit resistance as a high-priority reward factor.

This integration will allow the framework to proactively uncover vulnerabilities that only manifest under certain chain-specific behaviors or gas environments—closing a critical gap in multi-chain contract security.

## 6. Expected Outcomes

- A functional, LLM-driven agentic AI system for Solidity contract auditing and patch generation.
- Improved precision, recall, and F1 score compared to traditional analysis tools.
- Integration with developer IDEs, GitHub Actions, and CI/CD pipelines for seamless use.
- A continuously learning and improving AI agent trained on real-world contract data and feedback.
- A growing dataset of real, synthetic, and patched smart contracts that can be open-sourced for research reproducibility and community use.
- Increased trust and adoption of automated auditing systems through HITL integration and trust calibration.

## 7. Implications and Impact

This research can reduce the reliance on manual audits, enable real-time feedback for developers, and prevent significant financial losses due to undetected smart contract flaws. By harnessing the power of LLMs trained on specialized smart contract datasets, the system can offer context-aware suggestions and autonomous mitigation. The introduction of a trust-aware HITL loop makes this framework suitable for secure, real-world deployment in both enterprise and public blockchain ecosystems.


## 8. Summary of Contributions and Limitations

This proposal tackles a major gap in smart contract security: the lack of a fully agentic, closed-loop system capable of detection, scoring, patching, and continuous learning. It introduces a hybrid framework that combines symbolic/static analysis with LLM reasoning and reinforcement learning. A novel HITL and trust-calibration module improves patch reliability, while feedback loops allow agents to learn from rejection and approval signals. However, limitations remain in explainability, compute costs, and generalization to novel vulnerabilities. Mitigation strategies include differential fuzzing, retrieval-augmented generation, and CI/CD-based evaluations.
