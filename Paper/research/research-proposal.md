# Agentic AI for Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection and Mitigation

## 1. Introduction

Smart contracts are self-executing programs running on blockchain platforms, primarily Ethereum, coded in languages like Solidity. Despite their benefits, smart contracts are susceptible to security vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial and reputational losses. Traditional manual auditing methods are time-consuming, error-prone, and incapable of scaling with the growing number of deployed contracts.

The emergence of agentic AI, which combines language models with autonomous decision-making capabilities, opens new avenues for intelligent automation in cybersecurity. This proposal aims to develop an agentic AI framework that automatically analyzes, detects, scores, and mitigates vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts.

## 2. Problem Statement

Smart contract vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, integer overflows/underflows, unhandled exceptions, and gas-related issues are prevalent and exploited frequently. Existing tools offer either static or dynamic analysis, often requiring expert intervention for interpreting results and applying fixes. There is a critical need for an end-to-end AI system that autonomously identifies and mitigates these vulnerabilities while learning continuously from new threats.

## 3. Objectives

- To develop an AI-based framework for automated auditing of Solidity smart contracts.
- To implement a vulnerability scoring engine based on CVSS or similar frameworks.
- To integrate agentic AI (LLMs with tools) that can suggest and optionally apply fixes.
- To continuously train the model using a reinforcement learning approach based on real-world vulnerability data.

## 4. Literature Review

Several studies have explored smart contract vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies:

- **Luu et al. (2016)** introduced Oyente, a symbolic execution tool for detecting security bugs in Ethereum smart contracts. While effective, it lacks autonomous remediation capabilities.

- **Tsankov et al. (2018)** developed Securify, a static analysis tool that verifies smart contract properties. However, it doesn't provide actionable fixes or adapt over time.

- **Chen et al. (2020)** surveyed AI applications in blockchain security, highlighting the potential of machine learning for anomaly detection but not specifically for smart contract patching.

- **Kumar et al. (2022)** explored using GPT-3 for smart contract code generation and summarization, suggesting that LLMs can understand Solidity to some extent.

- **OpenAI's function calling and tool-use abilities (2023)** enabled agentic systems capable of integrating code analysis, API calls, and decision-making, ideal for smart contract auditing.

Despite these advancements, no system fully leverages agentic AI to perform vulnerability detection and automated mitigation in a closed loop.

## 5. Methodology

### Data Collection

Use datasets from the Smart Contract Weakness Classification (SWC), real-world exploits, and public GitHub repositories.

### Static & Dynamic Analysis

Integrate existing tools (e.g., Mythril, Slither) to extract vulnerability vectors.

### Scoring Engine

Implement a CVSS-inspired AI model that evaluates the severity of identified vulnerabilities.

### Agentic AI Design

- Use GPT-4 or similar LLMs with fine-tuning on Solidity.
- Design agents capable of code parsing, issue explanation, and fix generation.
- Build a sandbox environment for validation of proposed fixes.

### Reinforcement Learning Loop

- Reward agents for successfully resolving vulnerabilities without introducing new ones.
- Continuously update the agent policy using feedback from real-world contract deployments.
